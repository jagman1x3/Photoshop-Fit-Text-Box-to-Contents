# Photoshop-Fit-Text-Box-to-Contents
Resizes text layers in Photoshop to fit their contents without changing the shape of the text.
This makes transforming text much easier, since the boundaries of the transform box are set by the bounding box and it can be annoying to deal with large boxes for small text.
